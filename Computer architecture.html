            In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the
            functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.
            Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a
            computer but not a particular implementation

            Modern computer performance is often described in instructions per cycle (IPC), which measures the
            efficiency of the architecture at any clock frequency; a faster IPC rate means the computer is faster. Older
            computers had IPC counts as low as 0.1 while modern processors easily reach near 1. Superscalar processors
            may reach three to five IPC by executing several instructions per clock cycle

    <div id="Power efficiency">
        <p>
            Power efficiency is another important measurement in modern computers. A higher power efficiency can often
            be traded for lower speed or higher cost. The typical measurement when referring to power consumption in
            computer architecture is MIPS/W (millions of instructions per second per watt).
            Modern circuits have less power required per transistor as the number of transistors per chip grows. This is
            because each transistor that is put in a new chip requires its own power supply and requires new pathways to
            be built to power it. However the number of transistors per chip is starting to increase at a slower rate.
            Therefore, power efficiency is starting to become as important, if not more important than fitting more and
            more transistors into a single chip. Recent processor designs have shown this emphasis as they put more
            focus on power efficiency rather than cramming as many transistors into a single chip as possible.[19] In
            the world of embedded computers, power efficiency has long been an important goal next to throughput and
            latency.

    <div id="Implementation">
        <p>
            Once an instruction set and micro-architecture have been designed, a practical machine must be developed. This design process is called the implementation. Implementation is usually not considered architectural design, but rather hardware design engineering. Implementation can be further broken down into several steps:
